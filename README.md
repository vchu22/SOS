## About the Project
After brainstorming a list of several unique ideas, our team decided to work on a project with the theme of climate change in mind. Living here, in the state of Florida, makes this subject especially relevant since we are already at risk of experiencing powerful hurricanes and flooding every year.

As such, we conceptualized our project as a cautionary tale -- one where a survivor in the far future is stranded on an island and ultimately doomed to perish after failing to contact help. The player character's efforts would involve a gameplay loop that demonstrates our over-dependence on fossil fuels and the harm it has caused.

Developing the project as a team was a fun and rewarding experience, with plenty of challenges to match! Everyone had a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities, so everyone was actively contributing to the project at all times; however, the group, as a whole, wasn't always aware of what features each individual member was working on.

Additionally, the team did a wonderful job communicating what the scope of the project would be -- a very important consideration given the short period of time to work on the project! And yet, the scope was still too large and several basic features were scrapped last minute in order to complete the project.

But to reiterate, the project was a product of passion from a team of experienced programmers and a first time Hacker.

## Gameplay
